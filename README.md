# SeismoLift

**SeismoLift** is an open-source tool developed to determine the **seismic categories of elevators** in accordance with **NP EN 1998-1:2009** (*Eurocode 8*) and **EN 81-77* standards.  
Designed specifically for Portugal, it helps engineers, architects, and safety specialists evaluate location-based seismic zones efficiently and reliably.

## 🔍 Features

- Region-specific lookup for **Portugal Continental**, **Madeira**, and **Azores**
- Handles municipalities (concelhos) with duplicate names across regions
- Extracts seismic zone types and acceleration values directly from official data
- Clean CLI interface and modular code
- Generates reports to assist in compliance and documentation
